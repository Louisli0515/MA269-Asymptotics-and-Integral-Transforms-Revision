# MA269-Asymptotics-and-Integral-Transforms-Revision
My own notes about the MA269 revision, mainly from the notes and example sheets

## Lecture notes

First of all, feel free to download the 2022-2023 lecture notes for MA269 Asymptotics and Integral Transforms.

## Formula sheet

Second, in this module, we are going to cover a lot of computations, so some expansions and formulas are really useful.
